            What is the biggest challenge in the startup world? We think it is
            finding the right talent. The hustle is uncalled for and does not
            even guarantee a positive outcome. Founders often find it tricky
            when they decide to form a team whose values align with the
            companies.

          <p class="mt-8">
            But are we doing something different now? Every company is working
            with the same old channels over and over. Then we expect a different
            result. That's not how it works. So, it is time to reinvent a new
            strategy before we start the hiring process.

            So, in this blog, MarsDevs introduces a new method of talent
            outsourcing that will make your life easier. How much more would you
            wait for the talent market to normalize?

            Why rent an individual when you can have an army of experts working
            for you?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-10">
            Leaders know the layman's method of hiring individuals. It has been
            going on for years now. We hire outside talent to help us with
            consultancy and look forward to hiring them full-time. But, with the
            dominance of technology in every field, you need a team now. And it
            just got trickier.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8">
            What do you think is the best way to hire the team? The answer is
            simple. Right? You hire individuals and then make them work
            together. But would that work?
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8">
            Consider this situation. It would be best if you had a team of five
            techies; of course, you want the experts in the field. You hire five
            and make them work together. How sure are you that they would fit
            in? Even after hiring the best and the most experienced individuals,
            you can not guarantee they would work well together.

            But why do you need an individual when you get a team of experts
            working for you. Yes, we are talking about outsourcing. There are a
            lot of myths about the concept, but the truth is the efficiency of
            this strategy stands out. They are easy to hire and already are a
            team of experts. What more would you need?

            Do we need a tech founder to start a business now? Can a non-tech
            person be a founder? Can a non-tech person start a tech startup?
            Several questions bother us founders day and night. And since the
            emergence of technological advances, the questions keep increasing.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-8">
            The answer is simple. It is excellent if you are a tech founder, but
            you can get going without being one too. Hiring a team to assist you
            can seem tricky, and we can see why. But you can always hire a
            capability instead. By capability, we mean an organization that can
            help you solve tech issues and streamline processes without having a
            tech team ready.

            These partnerships present you with a helping hand for your tech
            needs. And when you have excellent tech assistance, you have a
            competitive advantage too. It is easy to get going and sustain
            yourself in the ever-changing tech landscape. The experts are ready,
